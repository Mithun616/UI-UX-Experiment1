# UI-UX-Experiment1

## Aim:

To understand the fundamentals of UI and UX, differentiate them through real-world examples, explore their relationship in product design, and demonstrate the usage of modern UI/UX tools such as Adobe XD and Sketch.
## Algorithm:

Start

Study the theoretical concepts of UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience).

Collect real-world case studies (e.g., Google, Amazon, Instagram).

Analyze UI and UX aspects separately in each case study.

Identify how UI and UX elements work together in user-centered design.

Select UI/UX tools (Adobe XD and Sketch) for demonstration.

Create sample wireframes, mockups, and prototypes using these tools.

Observe how design changes impact usability and appearance.

Compare outputs and gather insights on effective design practices.
